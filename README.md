# Education-based demos

This repository group demos I use to demonstrate use cases in Education. I typically use these examples in my presentations and conversations with customers. Contributions to this repo are welcome.

Below you can find all the demos currently available at the repo.

* **[Questions Generator](/gcp/questionsgenerator/)**. Demonstrates how to automatically extract questions from a given article or whatever text-based content. It is a web application written in Node.js.
